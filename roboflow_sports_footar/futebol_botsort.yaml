# BoT-SORT Tracker Configuration for Football/Soccer
# =================================================
# Optimized for football match recordings with camera panning/zooming
#
# Key Features:
# - GMC (Global Motion Compensation) using Sparse Optical Flow
# - High track buffer (60 frames = ~2.4s @ 25fps) for occlusions
# - Low detection threshold to handle motion blur/partial visibility
# - Aggressive matching for fast-moving players

tracker_type: botsort  # BoT-SORT with GMC support

# Track Management
track_high_thresh: 0.6   # Threshold for high-confidence track initialization
track_low_thresh: 0.1    # Accept weak detections (motion blur, partial occlusion)
new_track_thresh: 0.7    # Threshold for creating new tracks
track_buffer: 60         # Keep lost tracks for 60 frames (~2.4s @ 25fps)
match_thresh: 0.8        # IOU threshold for matching detections to tracks
fuse_score: true         # Fuse confidence score with IOU for better matching

# Global Motion Compensation (CRITICAL for football)
# Compensates for camera panning, tilting, and zooming
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow  # Options: orb, sift, ecc, sparseOptFlow, none
                           # sparseOptFlow: Best balance speed/accuracy for sports

# ReID (Re-Identification) - Appearance-based matching
# Helps re-identify players after long occlusions
with_reid: false         # Enable/disable ReID (appearance matching)
                         # false = faster, true = more robust (requires ReID model)
proximity_thresh: 0.5    # Spatial distance threshold for ReID
appearance_thresh: 0.25  # Appearance similarity threshold (lower = stricter)
model: auto              # ReID model path or 'auto' (osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt)

# Kalman Filter Parameters
# Predicts player positions between frames
# Football players have complex motion (acceleration, deceleration, direction changes)
# Default values work well, but can be tuned if needed

# Performance Tuning
# For real-time processing, consider:
# - gmc_method: none (disables GMC, faster but less accurate)
# - track_buffer: 30 (reduces memory, faster)
# For offline/quality priority:
# - Keep current settings (GMC enabled, high buffer)
